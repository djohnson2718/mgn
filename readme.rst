Installation
==============

The module is distributed on PyPI. You just need to run the following command: ::

    $ sage -pip install mgn --user

The ``â€“user`` option is optional and allows you to install the module in your user space (and does not require administrator rights). 

(figure this part out) If that doesn't work try updating sage (some earlier versions of sage are packaged with an incompatible version of PyPI.)

If that still fails, try downloading the source, extracting it, opening a terminal in the directory that has the ``setup.py`` file, and run: ::

    $ sage setup.py -install

mgn Package
============

The ``mgn`` package contains two modules for computations on the moduli space of curves.

strataalgebra
--------------

This module computes product in the strata algebra. It also contains some of A. Pixton's code to compute FZ relations. `Read the documentation <https://rawgit.com/uberparagon/mgn/master/strataalgebra/_build/html/index.html>`__.


To see if it is installed, try: ::
    
    sage: from strataalgebra import *
    sage: StrataAlgebra(QQ, 1, (1,2))
    Strata algebra with genus 1 and markings (1, 2) over Rational Field
    
topintersections
----------------- 

This module computes top intersections. `Read the documentation <https://rawgit.com/uberparagon/mgn/master/topintersections/_build/html/index.html>`__.

To see if it is installed, try: ::
    
    sage: from topintersections import *
    sage: space(1, 2)
    [1]  psi1
    [2]  psi2
    [3]  ka1
    [4]  ka2
    [5]  ch1
    [6]  irr
    [7]  Dg0m1_2
    [8]  la1
    Mbar_1_2
    sage: intnum(psi1*psi2)
    Computing the intersection of psi1*psi2 over Mbar_1_2...
