strataalgebra Documentation
=============================
Welcome! The ``strataalgebra`` module is designed to compute products in the strata algebra using sage. The strata algebra is of interest
because it has a natural surjective morphism to the tautological ring of the moduli space of curves. The kernel is described by the Faber-Zagier relations.

The product structure was implemented by `Drew Johnson`_, based on `S. Yang's note`_ describing the algorithm of Graber and
Pandharipande.
The program also computes the FZ relations using code copied from A. Pixton's `tautrel.sage`_ program.
The code was integrated into this package (with some modifications and optimizations) by Drew Johnson
(who takes responsibility for any bugs introduced!).

Installation
=========================================
Installation should be (hopefully) easy. ``strataalgebra`` is distributed as part of the `mgn package`_.

.. _mgn package: https://github.com/uberparagon/mgn

Once it is installed, you can load it in a sage session by typing: ::

    sage: from strataalgebra import *
